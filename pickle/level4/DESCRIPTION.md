Hey, remember that time Plankton used a cannon to fire a massive pickle at the Krusty Krab in the second SpongeBob movie?
Do you recall how it blew up into tiny pickle pieces upon impact, and those pickle pieces rained down upon Bikini Bottom?  
Well, now he needs me to pick up the pickle pieces for him so he can add them to his Chum Burgers at the Chum Bucket.  
Also, he stole the Itsukushima Shrine's floating torii so that he could put it in front of the Chum Bucket as his new entrance.  
Anyway, I made another Flask calculator with the help of Plankton's wife Karen. This time, I'm using external templates.
