Welcome to the Lectures module! This module will introduce you to the wonderful world of YouTube embeds.

In order to receive credit for watching these lectures, expand the challenge, press the "Start" button, and then once it has started, watch the lecture [here](/workspace/challenge). Once you have finished watching the lecture (the bar at the bottom should be completely green), a flag should pop up. Copy and paste that flag into the challenge to receive credit. Then, watch the next lecture.

This lecture watching workflow is new, and will probably need to be adjusted/improved as we go. Please have a little bit of patience as we figure this out and message @.hanto on Discord if you run into any issues.
