# Lofi Girl

**Lofi Girl** (formerly **ChilledCow** until 2021) is a French YouTube channel and music label established in 2017. It provides livestreams of lo-fi hip hop music 24/7, accompanied by a Japanese-style animation of a girl studying or relaxing in her bedroom with a cat on the window.

## History

### Creation and initial suspensions

The YouTube channel "ChilledCow" was created by Dimitri Somoguy on 18 March 2015. ChilledCow began streaming lo-fi hip hop music, branding it as relaxation music for those who are working or studying on 25 February 2017.

The live stream was taken down by YouTube between July and August 2017 for using footage of the character Shizuku Tsukishima studying from the animated film *Whisper of the Heart* (1995). In September 2017, the livestream was later reinstated with a custom animation of a girl studying.

In February 2020, YouTube briefly removed the channel without explanation, but reinstated it after a public backlash. The original live stream that was stopped by the take-down was 13,000 hours long, making it one of the longest videos on YouTube.

### Renaming and subsequent history

On 18 March 2021, six years after the creation of the channel, it was announced that the channel would rebrand from *ChilledCow* to *Lofi Girl*. The YouTube community posts explained how Lofi Girl had become the icon of the channel, and that it would fit as the new channel name.

On 2 February 2022, the channel reached the milestone of ten million subscribers. The stream that was on at the time had been running since 22 February 2020, and had over seven million likes. The channel celebrated this by having a party event in the chat.

On 10 July 2022, YouTube took down two of the channel's streams ("beats to relax/study to" and "beats to chill/sleep to") after receiving a Digital Millennium Copyright Act takedown request from Malaysian record label FMC Music Sdn Bhd. The two streams had nearly 800 million combined views and had been streaming continuously for about 21,000 hours each. YouTube later confirmed that the copyright infringement claims were "abusive" and that the claimant's channel had been terminated. Lofi Girl resumed streaming on 12 July. According to a spokesman for FMC Music, the copyright claims were filed by hackers who had gained access to the company's YouTube account. Following the incident, Lofi Girl criticized YouTube for not investigating the claims more thoroughly and for not providing content creators an opportunity to appeal false claims.

## Author's note

The aforementioned 20,844 hour long stream is [here](https://youtu.be/5qap5aO4i9A), but the VOD is still processing, so I'll have you watch the current stream for 20,844 hours instead.
